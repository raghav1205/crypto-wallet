**Knapsack** is a crypto wallet generator built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, designed to create and manage wallets for multiple blockchain platforms, including **Solana (SOL)** and **Ethereum (ETH)**. It leverages the **Hierarchical Deterministic (HD)** wallet generation algorithm to derive multiple wallets from a single seed phrase.

## Features

- **Seed Phrase Display**: Securely generate and display the seed phrase for backup.
- **HD Wallet Generation**: Generate multiple wallets from a single seed phrase using the BIP32, BIP39, and BIP44 standards.
- **Multi-Blockchain Support**: Create and manage wallets for both Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) networks.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive UI built with Next.js for ease of use and seamless interaction.
- **TypeScript**: Entire codebase is written in TypeScript to ensure type safety and scalability.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), TypeScript
- **Libraries**:  Web3.js, Solana Web3.js, HD Key Generation (BIP32/BIP39/BIP44)
- **Blockchain Support**: Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH)
